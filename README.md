Unlike existing WebDriver client libraries that assume the remote server will
just do the Right Thing, Leadfoot detects and works around inconsistencies in
WebDriver server implementations, using native WebDriver/Selenium commands when
possible, so you can just worry about making your tests work—not bugs in
WebDriver servers.

Enhanced capabilities are also exposed to end-users about which features and
APIs a remote environment supports, so you don’t have to browser sniff to decide
whether (for example) you’re testing a touch-device or a mouse-device. Optional
convenience methods are also available for use, and support for chai-as-promised
is built in.

Leadfoot has been tested with the following remote drivers:

- InternetExplorerDriver
- Microsoft WebDriver
- FirefoxDriver
- geckodriver
- ChromeDriver
- SafariDriver
- safaridriver (native)
- Selendroid
- ios-driver

## Using Leadfoot

Leadfoot can be installed and used as a
[stand-alone library](docs/how_to.md#use-leadfoot-as-a-standalone-library). It
is also an integral part of the
[Intern testing framework](https://theintern.io), which provides you with all of
the tools you need to write robust unit and functional tests. Follow the
instructions on
[writing functional tests with Intern](https://theintern.io/docs.html#Intern/4/docs/docs%2Fwriting_tests.md/functional-tests)
to learn how to use Leadfoot with Intern.

## Firefox, Safari, and Edge

Firefox 49+, Safari 10+, and Microsoft Edge are all on the bleeding edge of
WebDriver-based browser automation. They all use relatively new drivers that
implement the still-under-development W3C WebDriver standard, so feature support
is spotty at times. For best results, use the most recent versions of Selenium
and the browser’s native driver (geckodriver, Microsoft WebDriver, or
safaridriver), and the most recent browser version in Firefox’s case.
